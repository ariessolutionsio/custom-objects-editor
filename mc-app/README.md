# Custom Object Editor

## Overview
This project is a commercetools custom application that allows the end user to create, view, and manage custom objects directly from the Merchant Center. Custom objects are an extremely powerful feature of the Composable Commerce offering and is useful for storing all sorts of diverse data. This application adds to that power by exposing this data to a business user without the need to go through APIs.

### Key Features
- **User Interface:** Professional user interface that seemlessly matches the Merchant Center design.
- **Easy Deploy:** The application can easily be deployed into multiple projects or organizations directly through the Merchant Center.
